# Smallchat

运行make 
先运行./smallchat-server
输入./smallchat-client localhost 7711即可

TLDR: This is just a programming example for a few friends of mine. It somehow turned into a set of programming videos, continuing one project I started some time ago: Writing System Software videos series.

1. [First episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eT02gzeLmF0), how the basic server works.
2. [Second episode](https://youtu.be/yogoUJ2zVYY), writing a simple client with raw terminal handling.

Likely more will follow, stay tuned.

是真的，你是真是
